# web3_dropbox
A Decentralized version of Dropbox. A dapp where you store files on the blockchain with the ability to also share them to others
I plan on using pinata to pin the files on IPFS then store the hashes gotten to the blockchain.
I just did a prototype of the smart contract on remix, decided to start developing in the hardhat environment.
I am currently working on the frontend before going back to the smartcontract to write some test and scripts.
